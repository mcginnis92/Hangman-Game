# Hangman-Game

## Purpose
Harry Potter Hangman was created as a basic logic game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
Guess Harry Potter-themed keywords before your lives run out to win the game! Simply type a letter to start guessing.

## Installation
To play the game:
Clone or download this repository.
Run index.html in your web browser.
Press a key to start guessing!

Please note: this game is not mobile compatible since it requires keystrokes to run.

## Ideas for Future Development
In the future I hope to make the code more dry and object oriented.
